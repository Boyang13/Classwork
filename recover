Open memory card
Look for beginning of JPEG
Open a new JPEG file
Write 512 bytes until new JPEG is found
Stop at the end of the file*/

Has the first three starting bytes
Last bytes is similar
JPEGs are stored back-to-back in memory card
Each block is 512 bytes*/

Once opened, I can open a new JPEG file to start writing to
Once I encounter another JPEG heading, I close the old one to start the new one, and repeat*/
